## 4.4 Practice

Why does this code not work?
```{r}
my_variable <- 10
my_varıable
#> Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'my_varıable' not found
```
Look carefully! (This may seem like an exercise in pointlessness, but training your brain to notice even the tiniest difference will pay off when programming.)

Because there's the i in the second variable is not an i.

Tweak each of the following R commands so that they run correctly:
```{r}
library(tidyverse)

# ggplot(dota = mpg) + 
#   geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
# 
# fliter(mpg, cyl = 8)
# filter(diamond, carat > 3)

######

ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))

filter(mpg, cyl == 8)
filter(diamonds, carat > 3)
```

Press Alt + Shift + K. What happens? How can you get to the same place using the menus?
